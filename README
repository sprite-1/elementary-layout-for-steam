What is the point of this project?
----------------------------------
This is merely an edit to the default Steam skin. This does
not aim to make a whole new design but simply t move around
the elements on the user interface so it matches closer to 
the aesthetic of elementary OS.


Status
------
As this isn't at the top of my priorities, I will just be
making changes to it as time goes on with no set schedule.

As of right now, only the main window has been modified.


How to use?
-----------
Clone this repo and inside ~/.steam/steam/skins, make a new
folder called "elementary_layout" and put the contents in.


Thanks for reading!
